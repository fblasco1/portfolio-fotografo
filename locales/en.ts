The streets of Buenos Aires have become scenes of massive protests.

    "vidaBajoOcupacionTexto": "The Israeli occupation has shaped daily dynamics in Palestine, creating a context of permanent restrictions and repression. The Israeli army deploys thousands of soldiers in the West Bank, conducting daily incursions into cities and towns, resulting in injuries, deaths, and kidnappings without judicial orders. Daily life is affected by a regime that limits mobility and restricts access to basic resources. However, Palestinians continue to resist life under occupation. This material is part of the book On the Other Side of the Wall.",
    "elMuroTitulo": "The Apartheid Wall",
    "elMuroTexto": "The separation wall built by Israel in Palestinian territory is a symbol of occupation and apartheid. Along its more than 700 kilometers, the wall crosses landscapes, communities, and lives, dividing families and restricting freedoms. This physical barrier profoundly affects the daily life of those living under its shadow, a shadow that extends, like resistance and struggle, amid oppression. This material is part of the book On the Other Side of the Wall.",
